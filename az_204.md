# Module 1: Explore Azure App Service:

1. Implement Azure App Service web apps

    - HTTP-based service for hosting web apps, REST APIS, etc. in Windows- or Linux-based environments.
    - Auto-scale of resources and container support
    - CI/CD support
    - DEV and PROD slot dep. On payment plan
    - App Service support different runtimes, check with: `az webapp list-runtimes --os-type linux`
    - A custom container option is supported, helps to avoid limits; like storage volume latency,
      it places files in the container filesystem instead of on the content volume
    -
2. Examine Azure App Service plans

    - An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run
    - Each App Service plan defines:

        - Operating System (Windows, Linux)
        - Region (West US, East US, etc.)
        - Number of VM instances
        - Size of VM instances (Small, Medium, Large)
        - Pricing tier: Shared, Dedicated, Isolated (runs with others, runs all yours, runs only this one app)
    - App Service Plan is a scale unit: all apps run on all VMs defined, more resources needed → isolate in a separate
      service plan

3. Deploy to App Service

    - App Service supports both automated and manual deployment
    - CI/CD from:

        - Azure DevOps Services
        - GitHub
        - BitBucket
    - Manual deployment:

        - Git URL
        - CLI: `webapp up` (can create a new app)
        - `curl`: send ZIP resources to App Service
        - FTP/S
    - Deployment slots: allows deploying to staging and swap staging and prod → swap warms up the worker
    - Container deployment:

        - Build and tag the image
        - Push the tagged image
        - Update the deployment slot with the new image tag

4. Explore authentication and authorization in App Service

    - Built-in authentication feature: supports Auth without own implementing
    - Multiple providers supported (Facebook, Googel, GitHub, any OpenID provider like Okta)
    - Any HTTP request passes through auth module:

        - Authenticates users and clients with the specified identity provider
        - Validates, stores, and refreshes OAuth tokens issued by the configured identity provider
        - Manages the authenticated session
        - Injects identity information into HTTP request headers
    - Can be configured using Azure Resource Manager settings or using a configuration file
    - Authentication flow:

        - Without provider SDK: browser apps, rendering a sign-in form from provider
        - With provider SDK: browser less apps without sig-in form from provider; manually sign-in and then submit the
          auth token to App Service for validation
    - Authorization behavior:

        - Allow unauthenticated requests
        - Require authentication
    - App Service provides a built-in token store

5. Discover App Service networking features

    - Problem: you can't connect the App Service network directly to your network (thre is not only you as a customer)
    - There are in- and outbound features to control calls to and from your app
    - Roles: fron ends (for incoming calls) and workers (for user tasks)
    - Default behavior: all apps on one worker, if scaled, all apps are replicated to a new one
    - Outbound addresses: there's a property called `possibleOutboundIpAddresses` (all possible)
      or `outboundIpAddresses` that lists them:

      ```
      az webapp show \
      --resource-group <group_name> \
      --name <app_name> \
      --query outboundIpAddresses \
      --output tsv
      ```
6. Example: creating a static HTML app and deploy to Azure App Service:

    - Using the Azure CLI command: `az webapp up`:

        - Create a default resource group if one isn't specified.
        - Create a default app service plan.
        - Create an app with the specified name.
        - Zip deploy files from the current working directory to the web app.
    - Set variables to hold the resource group and app names:
      `resourceGroup=$(az group list --query "[].{id:name}" -o tsv) appName=az204app$RANDOM`
    - Create web app: `az webapp up -g $resourceGroup -n $appName --html`
